Data exploration, analysis and visualisation was done using Excel to find the trends in customer segments, which customers have the highest customer value using RFM analysis. Data analysis was done on both old and new customers. 

<h1>Introduction</h1>
Sprocket is a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMGâ€™s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. 
Two datasets are analysed: Transaction and Customer Demographic to better help Sprocket optimise its marketing strategy.

4 graphs are generated:
1) : Customers are grouped into Gold, Platinum, Bronze and Silver
2) New Customer Age Distribution: To find out the distribution of new customers' age group purchasing from Sprocket
3) Old Customer Age Distribution: To find out the distribution of old customers' age group purchasing from Sprocket
4) Number of Cars Owned in each state: To find out which state has the most car owners to allow Sprocket to focus on which state more on its marketing strategy


<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
Missing data are removed, data transformation is done to convert data to their respective type for calculation, grouping of data are done for easier analyse such as age group instead of DOB.
Inconsistency of naming are such as gender M, Male, F, Femal, Female are converted to Female and Male.

<h2>Data Visualisation</h2>
Useful information such as looking at customer's age would provide Sprocket with the target audience to do their marketing strategy. Also, state with car ownership also allow Sprocket to target state with less car owners. 

<h2>Insights</h2>
<b>RFM segmentation bar chart</b>
From the bar chart, most of Sprocket's customers are bronze followed by gold, platinum and lastly silver.
